    <h1>Opinion: Are “zero” labels messing with our brains?</h1>
    <p class="subhed">When a drink says “zero sugar” do we assume health? Maybe that’s the problem.</p>
    <div class="meta">By Opinion Editor | <time datetime="2025-10-29">October 29, 2025</time> | Opinion</div>

    <p>We’ve all grabbed the can that says “Zero Sugar” or “Diet” and felt just a little bit healthier for doing so. But recent research suggests these labels may create a health-halo effect—where we assume a product is “good for me” simply because of the branding.</p>

    <p>A 2023 experimental study found that sugar-free labels significantly increase willingness to pay for products because consumers perceive them as healthier — even though other nutritional aspects (like additives, flavourings or metabolic effects) may not change. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}</p>

    <p>In short: the “zero” label may fool our brains. We might drink more of something because we believe it’s harmless—and combine it with other indulgences. A dangerous cocktail of perception and behaviour.</p>

    <blockquote>“Sugar-free labels significantly increase the willingness to pay … however this positive effect is overridden by a significant decrease in perceived sweetness (and hence, tastiness).” – Panidi et al. 2023 :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}</blockquote>

    <p>Meanwhile, policy-research shows that front-of-package warning labels (for high sugar, high calorie) can reduce sugary drink purchases. For example, one model predicted warning labels reduced obesity prevalence by 1.7 % in Baltimore. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}</p>

    <p>These insights point towards a troubling implication: if “zero sugar” drinks are perceived as instantly healthier, consumers may relax other behaviours (higher calorie meals, less exercise), or overlook less-obvious risks (sweeteners, additives, behavioural compensations).</p>

    <h3>Here’s what to bear in mind:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“Zero sugar” ≠ “zero impact” — sweeteners and other ingredients still have metabolic/behavioural footprints.</li>
      <li>Marketing matters. If you feel indulgent, you might indulge more.</li>
      <li>Whole-diet context beats single labels. One “zero” drink won’t fix a bad diet; nor will it guarantee good health.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the arena of food science and public health, labels like “zero” may be more about consumer psychology than actual health impact. The next time you reach for that can, ask yourself: is it really a health move, or just a marketing one?</p>
