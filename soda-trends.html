    <h1>Data Dive: Soda consumption trends in 2020-2025</h1>
    <p class="subhed">What the numbers reveal about zero-sugar, diet and traditional sodas in recent years.</p>

    <p>The beverage landscape is shifting. According to recent market research, zero-sugar and low-/no-calorie soda categories are growing significantly, while traditional sugar-sweetened sodas face headwinds. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}</p>

    <p>### What the data suggests<br>
    - Consumers are increasingly choosing “zero sugar” or “diet” versions. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}<br>
    - Despite growth in these categories, the total “healthy drink” shift is not automatic — many consumers still opt for traditional sodas, and substitution is incomplete. <br>
    - Market signals show opportunities for brands, but also concerns for public health: growth in zero-sugar options doesn’t necessarily equal less overall soda consumption or improved health outcomes.</p>

    <p>### Health & policy implications<br>
    - Rapid growth of zero-sugar products means public health messaging must adapt. Just because a beverage is labelled “zero” doesn’t guarantee it is benign.<br>
    - Labeling policies matter: experiments show warning or content labels can modestly reduce soda purchasing. For instance, in Mexico, self-reported reductions in soda purchases followed introduction of warning-labels. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}<br>
    - Growth in market size may reflect both consumer demand and reformulation by manufacturers — but the underlying issue of beverage-overconsumption remains.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The period from 2020 to 2025 marks a phase of transition in the soda world. Zero-sugar and diet categories are growing rapidly, but the challenge for public health remains: shifting long-entrenched drinking habits, addressing perceptions of “healthier soda”, and ensuring growth of alternatives leads to real health benefits—not just marketing wins.</p>
